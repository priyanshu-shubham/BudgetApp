# GoodGoingBudget
This project is a "Budget App" with vanilla JavaScript.


This app shows, the balance, the income and the outcome. It also has a dashboard where the user can add a new entry (an income or an expense), and can toggle between the income list (that show only all income entries) and the expenses list (that shows only the outcome entries) and all list that shows all the entries.
The user can edit or delete an entry.
This app also has a chart, so the user can easily compare the income and outcome intuitively.

The user's income and expense entry list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, or reboot his machine, he can always find  his data there.

To contribute to this repo, kindly clone it on your local machine and then give a pull request after making changes.
